                        The increasing availability of text information in the form of news articles, comments or posts poses new challenges for those who aim to understand the storyline of an event. Although understanding natural language text has improved over the last couple of years with several research works emerging on the grounds of information extraction and text mining, the problem of constructing consistent narrative structures is yet to be solved. We still have a challenging path ahead of us for the development and improvement of algorithms that automatically identify, interpret and relate the different elements of a narrative which will be likely spread from different sources.

                        In this workshop, we aim to foster the discussion of recent advances in the link between Information Retrieval (IR) and formal narrative representations from texts. More specifically, we aim to capture a wide range of multidisciplinary issues related to the text-to-narrative-structure and to its various related tasks. The workshop will feature a diversity of tasks and techniques with promising results for an exciting task.

                 The continuous growth of social networks such as Facebook or Twitter, together with an ever increasing presence of news traditional media outlets in the web has led to the explosion of huge amounts of information being generated on a daily-basis in a way that any journalistic subject (e.g. Trump and Russia) is described in one or more texts produced by journalists and possibly commented by readers during days, weeks or months. With so much information being generated on the fly it turns out difficult for any reader to keep up-to-date making the process of reading and digesting the information into a cumbersome and inefficient task. One way to overcome these problems is to grasp a vast set of interconnected news articles or similar unstructured collections, to extract narrative/stories elements and re-represent them in intermediate data structures (structured data) that convey the essential story in a way that are more efficiently consumed by the readers Games are very attractive and can be particularly powerful to capture an audience [Kessing12], but other simpler forms of narrative representation such as semi-automatic generation of slide shows, infographics or video sequences are also challenging, useful and widely applicable [Liu 2013]. These will enable readers to quickly understand who are the main actors of a story, their interplay and their trajectories in time and space, motivations, main events, causal relations of events and outcomes without actually having the need to read the sources (a.k.a. distant reading [Mor05]). Although information extraction and natural language processing have achieved very relevant results towards the automatic interpretation of texts, the problem of fully identifying and relating the different elements of a narrative in a text or a set of texts is still a problem to be solved [John2016]. With this workshop we aim to raise awareness to the problem of creating a text-to-narrative-structure and its related tasks. This is a very rich line of research that poses many challenging problems in information retrieval, text mining, information extraction, computational linguistics and automatic production of media content. Research works submitted to the workshop should foster the scientific advance on all aspects of storyline generation from texts including but not limted to narrative and content generation, formal representation, and visualization of narratives. This includes the following topics:

                We aim for an interactive and dynamic full-day workshop that will include a keynote, paper and demo presentations. To promote an interactive atmosphere, we also plan to boost panel discussions between the participants of the workshop and attendees. Call for papers will be advertised in major email distribution lists and via an official web page (Text2Story18.inesctec.pt). We will solicit submissions of research papers (6 pages), demos and position papers (4 pages) in ACM double-column style. 

                Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee. Participants of accepted papers will be given 15 minutes for short oral presentation. All papers will also be presented in an interactive poster session to encourage more discussion and engagement between the participants of the workshop. We plan to publish the proceedings with CEUR workshop proceedings1. This guarantees timely publication (in time for the workshop) and a wide dissemination due to CEUR’s open-access policy. We will also produce a summary paper describing the main findings of the workshop to appear on SIGIR Forum. A special issue in a journal will also be considered depending on the relevance of the papers.
